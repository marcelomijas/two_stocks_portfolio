# Two stocks portfolio analysis with Python

Simple two stocks minimum-variance portfolio and tangency (optimal) portfolio analysis with Python using Harry Max Markowitz modern 
portfolio theory.

Created by [Marcelo Moreno](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcelomorenop/) and [Yago Cano](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yagocano/), from Universidad Rey Juan Carlos.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have installed the packages located in `requirements.txt`.
2. Download and execute `portfolio_analysis.py` with Python.
3. The program will ask you to introduce the ticker symbol of the first asset of the portfolio. Introduce it and press `Enter`. Repeat the procedure for the second asset.
4. The program will download data from the two assets introduced and the risk-free asset.
6. When the downloads are complete, the program will prompt you to press `Enter` to perform the calculations. Press it.
7. Per asset and portfolios statistics will be displayed.
7. The program will ask you to proceed with the investment oportunity set graphic representation in the return-risk space.
8. If graphic representation is selected, a matplotlib window will appear with the plot. You can zoom in, out, save the plot as an image... using the matplotlib interface. Close the matplotlib window when you are finished.
9. To finnish the program you can press `Enter` or close the terminal window.

By default, the program uses a time period of 5 year with 1 month intervals, the 'Close' price, 
and the risk-free asset is 10 year US bond yield (^TNX). Statistics are calculated as montly.

## Demo

Usage demo with Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI) and Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) stocks:

```

Ticker symbol of asset 1: NVDA
         NVIDIA Corporation
Ticker symbol of asset 2: TSLA
         Tesla, Inc.
Downloading assets: ['NVDA', 'TSLA']
[*********************100%***********************]  2 of 2 completed
Risk-free asset: ^TNX
         CBOE Interest Rate 10 Year T No
Download complete. Press Enter to perform the calculations
```

Pressing `Enter`:

```
rf = 0.04

Performance statistics:

Expected return      3.363   3.991
Standard deviation  10.300  19.256
Sharpe ratio         0.323   0.205
Covariance  -9.853
Correlation -0.050

Minimum-variance portfolio:
Ticker    NVDA   TSLA
weigths  0.767  0.233
Expected return     3.510
Standard deviation  8.890
Sharpe ratio        0.391

Tangency portfolio:
Ticker    NVDA   TSLA
weigths  0.738  0.262
Expected return     3.528
Standard deviation  8.913
Sharpe ratio        0.392

Plot the investment opportunity set? [Y/n]
